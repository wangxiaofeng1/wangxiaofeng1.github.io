## Research Projects

### Safe Learning-Enabled Control Systems 
A focal point of my upcoming research involves the integration of learning methodologies into control systems while ensuring robustness and safety. While machine learning (ML) heralds unprecedented levels of automation and autonomy, integrating it into safety-critical systems poses significant challenges. The opacity inherent in ML -- the difficulty in analyzing its decision-making processes -- presents hurdles in quantifying and mitigating uncertainties, especially when coupled with physical uncertainties. We addresses this challenge by proposing the Data-enabled Simplex (DeSimplex) solution, which facilitates a seamless transition of control authority from learning-based components to high-assurance solutions, maintaining safety thresholds and enabling continuous learning from operational environments to optimize performance and safety simultaneously. DeSimplex presents a pioneering approach that aims to harmonize learning mechanisms with safety assurances, promising advancements in autonomous system control. Its success hinges upon the seamless amalgamation of reliable perception, robust planning, (distributional) robust adaptive control, and intricate optimization techniques, coupled with comprehensive reachability analysis.

Beyond the DeSimplex framework, our interest extends to the realm of physics-informed neural networks and universal approximation theory. Understanding the intricate connections between fundamental physical laws and the functioning of deep neural networks holds immense promise. The exploration of how these theories can enrich and inform the design and operation of learning-based control systems presents an exciting avenue for future research.
