## About Me
I am an associate professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering at the University of South Carolina (USC), Columbia.  I earned my B.S. degree in Applied Mathematics and M.S. in Operation Research and Control Theory from East China Normal University in 2000 and 2003, respectively, and obtained my PhD degree in Electrical Engineering at the University of Notre Dame in 2009 under the supervision of Prof. Michael Lemmon.  After that, I worked as postdoctoral research associate at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in Prof. Naira Hovakimyan's group before joining USC. My research interests include model predcitive control, robust adaptive control, networked control systems, multi-agent systems, and machine learning, with their applications in robotics, cyber-physical systems, and autonomous systems. I am currently serving as associate editor of IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems, Journal of The Franklin Institute, and IEEE Control Systems Society Conference Board.  I received the best paper award in the Annual Conference of the Prognostics and Health Management Society in 2014 and was the finalist of the best paper award in International Conference on Cyber-Physical Systems in 2013.
